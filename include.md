### Welcome to Australian life table 2011-2013 application.

This application is based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics's regular publish which is available [here](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3302.0.55.001)

Source code is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/nth1502/DataApplicationDevelopmentProject.git).

lx : number of persons surviving to exact age x. 

qx : proportion of persons dying between exact age x and exact age x+1.

Lx : number of person years lived within the age interval x to x+1.

ex : expectation of life at exact age x.
